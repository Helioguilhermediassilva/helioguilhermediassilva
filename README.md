Hi, I'm Hélio Guilherme Dias Silva 👋

🚀 About Me

In a world that demands bold answers, NowGo emerged as a systemic response: a regenerative ecosystem of solutions with artificial intelligence at its core and one clear purpose — to solve humanity’s most critical challenges through technology, purpose, and real impact.

I lead this mission as CEO of NowGo Holding, structured around 9 corporate verticals and a global educational spin-off (StartES).

Previously, I served as Vice President at RiverRock Films, a Hollywood-based studio, where I led global fundraising and international partnerships from Brazil.

My vision is clear:

"True innovation happens when technology meets purpose."

NowGo is more than a company — it’s a platform for transformation that integrates innovation, capital, spirituality, and disciplined execution, with the belief that the future will be led by those who use technology with soul and intention.

🎯 Main Areas of Focus

My work and NowGo's projects span several areas, including:

🏥 Health: AI-powered clinical pre-diagnosis solutions for public and private healthcare.

📚 Education: Educational AI and intelligent agents for grant and funding acquisition. StartES, our spin-off, expands this impact as a global accelerator for financial education, entrepreneurship, and youth leadership.
